## Hi, I’m Waron 👋

CS student / Software Engineer. I try to make computers do things, sometimes correctly.

- Build software and think about performance at inappropriate times
- Write Go, C++, TypeScript (descending order of comfort; ascending order of how much I hate myself)
- Currently learning Haskell to feel intellectually superior
- Care about correctness, fundamentals, and codes that haunt me at 3am
